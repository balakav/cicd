          <h2>Project 3</h2>
          <h4>Description of project</h4>
          <p>In this system, we have tried to reduce restaurant food wastage by giving waste food to NGOs. NGOs will raise a request, in case of any leftover food restaurants have. <br></br>This request is sent to the restaurant manager of that particular restaurant. The NGO Manager then approves the request and assigns it to one of the NGO employees <br></br>for takeaway and forwards the request to the restaurant. The leftover food at the restaurant can be given to NGOs at the end of the day. The admin can track the history of <br></br>restaurants and NGOs for the leftover foods.</p>
